# UI/UX Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the UI/UX improvements and fixes implemented to address user-reported issues in the faculty availability management system and reports.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Faculty Unavailability Management Table Issues ✅

**Problem:** Actions buttons were overflowing from the table view, making them hard to use.

**Solution:**
- Fixed table actions column width and layout
- Changed button arrangement from horizontal to vertical stacking
- Added proper column width (`width: 200`) and fixed positioning (`fixed: 'right'`)
- Made buttons use `block` layout for better space utilization
- Shortened button text ("Assign Substitute" → "Assign") for better fit

**Files Modified:**
- `Advance-Timetable-Scheduling-Frontend/src/features/admin/Timetable/FacultyUnavailability.jsx`

### 2. Faculty Dashboard Leave Type Selection ✅

**Problem:** Faculty members couldn't specify the type of leave when submitting unavailability requests.

**Solution:**
- Added `Select` component for leave type selection in faculty dashboard modal
- Added state management for `unavailabilityType`
- Provided predefined options: Personal Leave, Sick Leave, Conference/Training, Emergency, Other
- Updated API calls to include the selected leave type
- Improved modal layout with better typography and spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `Advance-Timetable-Scheduling-Frontend/src/features/faculty/FacultyDashboard/FacultyDashboard.jsx`

**Leave Type Options Added:**
- `personal_leave` - Personal Leave
- `sick_leave` - Sick Leave  
- `conference` - Conference/Training
- `emergency` - Emergency
- `other` - Other

### 3. Teacher Allocation Report Styling Issues ✅

**Problem:** Subject rows were dark and not visible, cluttered layout made data hard to read.

**Solution:**
- Fixed subject tag styling from dark (`#282828`) to light blue theme
- Improved spacing between subject badges (`size={[4, 8]}`)
- Added proper color scheme: blue background (`#e6f7ff`) with blue text (`#1890ff`)
- Added borders and better padding for subject tags
- Enhanced readability with proper font size and spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `Advance-Timetable-Scheduling-Frontend/src/features/admin/Reports/TeacherAllocationReport.jsx`

### 4. PDF Export Functionality ✅

**Problem:** PDF export wasn't working for both Teacher Allocation and Space Occupancy reports.

**Solution:**
- Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Fixed table column sizing and data formatting
- Added null checks for data fields to prevent errors
- Improved table layout with better column widths
- Added user-friendly error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `Advance-Timetable-Scheduling-Frontend/src/features/admin/Reports/TeacherAllocationReport.jsx`
- `Advance-Timetable-Scheduling-Frontend/src/features/admin/Reports/SpaceOccupancyReport.jsx`

### 5. Faculty Assignment Data Issue ✅

**Problem:** All teachers showed "Unassigned" in the faculty field because faculty assignments were missing from the database.

**Solution:**
- Identified that faculty members are stored in `Users` collection with `role: "faculty"`
- Created script to assign faculty and department fields to all existing faculty users
- Assigned all faculty to "Faculty of Computing" with appropriate departments:
  - Computer Science
  - Software Engineering  
  - Information Systems
  - Information Technology

**Files Created:**
- `check_teacher_faculty.py` - Diagnostic script
- `assign_faculty_departments.py` - Faculty assignment script

**Database Updates:**
- Updated 22 faculty users with faculty and department assignments
- All faculty now properly categorized instead of showing "Unassigned"
